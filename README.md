Installation
------------

    $ git clone https://github.com/kaugm/dotfiles 
    $ cd dotfiles
    $ ./install
    # ./backup init

`install` uses `apt` to install the necessary packages for an \*buntu system. `backup` will copy over the necessary dotfiles to their respective locations\

##### Several repositories will be cloned and downloaded. Please make sure to compile these after running `install`.

##### Warning: Restoring will overwrite current dotfiles. Please back them up first
